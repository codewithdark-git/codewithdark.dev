# Getting Started with Next.js: A Beginner's Guide

Next.js has quickly become one of the most popular React frameworks for building modern web applications. In this post, we'll explore the basics of Next.js and why it's an excellent choice for your next project.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications. It's a production-ready framework that allows you to create full-stack web applications by extending the latest React features, and integrating powerful Rust-based JavaScript tooling for the fastest builds.

## Key Features of Next.js

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js allows you to render React components on the server, which can significantly improve the initial load time of your application.

2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: With Next.js, you can generate static HTML files for your pages at build time, resulting in faster page loads and improved SEO.

3. **File-based Routing**: Next.js uses a file-system based router built on the concept of pages. When a file is added to the `pages` directory, it's automatically available as a route.

4. **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to easily create API endpoints as Node.js serverless functions.

5. **Built-in CSS Support**: Next.js comes with built-in support for CSS and Sass, making it easy to style your applications.

In the next posts, we'll dive deeper into each of these features and show you how to leverage them in your projects. Stay tuned!
