# Mastering Python: Tips and Tricks for Efficient Coding

Python's simplicity and versatility have made it one of the most popular programming languages. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, there's always room to improve your Python skills. In this post, we'll explore some tips and tricks to help you write more efficient and Pythonic code.

for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)

# Use:
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
