# E-commerce Platform

This project is a comprehensive e-commerce solution built with a React frontend, Node.js backend, and MongoDB database. It includes features like user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and secure checkout with Stripe integration.

## Key Features

- User authentication and profile management
- Product catalog with search and filter functionality
- Shopping cart with persistent storage
- Secure checkout process integrated with Stripe
- Admin dashboard for managing products and orders

## Technical Implementation

The frontend is built with React, utilizing Redux for state management and React Router for navigation. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless authentication.

The integration with Stripe ensures secure handling of payment information, while the admin dashboard provides an easy way for store owners to manage their products and view order details.
