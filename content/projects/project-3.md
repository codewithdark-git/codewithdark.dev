# AI-powered Image Recognition App

This project is a mobile application that leverages machine learning for real-time image recognition. Built with React Native and integrated with a TensorFlow.js model, the app can identify objects, scenes, and even text within images captured by the device's camera.

## Features

- Real-time image recognition using device camera
- Offline functionality with on-device ML model
- History of recognized images and results
- Integration with a Flask backend for model updates

## Technical Details

The frontend is developed using React Native, ensuring a native feel on both iOS and Android devices. The core functionality relies on a TensorFlow.js model, which is integrated into the app for on-device inference, allowing for offline use and faster recognition times.

A Python Flask backend is used to periodically update the ML model and provide additional server-side processing for more complex recognition tasks. The app demonstrates the power of combining mobile development with machine learning technologies to create intelligent, responsive applications.
