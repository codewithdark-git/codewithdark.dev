# Personal Portfolio Website
![]
This project is a responsive portfolio website built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. It showcases my skills, projects, and blog posts in a modern and interactive design.

## Features

- Responsive design that looks great on all devices
- Dark mode toggle for better user experience
- Dynamic project and blog post pages generated from markdown files
- SEO optimized with Next.js built-in features

## Technical Details

The website is built with Next.js, utilizing its static site generation capabilities for optimal performance. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a utility-first approach that made it easy to create a consistent and responsive design.

The content for projects and blog posts is stored in markdown files, which are parsed and rendered dynamically. This approach allows for easy content management and updates.
